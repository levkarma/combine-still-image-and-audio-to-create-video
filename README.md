# Combine Still Image and Audio To Create Video

A small script for creating a video file from a folder of audio files, using an image for a background.

Essentially just a wrapper for FFMPEG. Eventually hope to integrate other options for batch processing this sort of video creation.

## Usage

```
node [path_to_script] [image] [folder_of_audio_files]
```
